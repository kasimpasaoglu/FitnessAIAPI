  "personalNote": "Health Warning: Since you're on Metoprolol (a beta blocker), monitor your heart rate during workouts and avoid sudden intensity spikes. Start with lighter weights and gradually progress. Stay hydrated and listen to your body. Motivational Tip: Consistency is key! Even small gains add up over time. Focus on protein-rich meals to support muscle growth (e.g., lean meats, eggs, legumes). Youâ€™ve got this, Kasim!"
