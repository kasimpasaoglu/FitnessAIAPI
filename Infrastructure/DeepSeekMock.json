  "personal_note": "Kasim, as a beginner at 60kg bodyweight, focus on perfecting your form before increasing weights. Track your weekly progress - you should aim to add 1-2kg to lifts every 2 weeks. Your current frame can likely support 5-7kg of muscle gain in this 8-week phase. Pay special attention to your bench press and squat form - these will be key indicators of your progress."
